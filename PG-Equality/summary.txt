The following discussion is for our method.
-----Sparsity------
Test problems with no sparsity
    - Converge to KKT point(but not global minimizer): BT1, BT7
    - Large KKT-measure: BT2, BT8, DIXCHLNG, HS78
    - Gurobi error: BT4, HS56 
For the first two cases, we handle them by enforcing larger regularzation parameter. 
For the thrid case, we reduce the merit parameter so that more penalty is added to constraint violation.

-----Status-----
MAX status: 
    - BT2, BT8, DIXCHLNG, ELEC, LCH.
    - HS111LNP(0.002091), HS26(4.580163348549879), HS47(0.000963), HS49(0.002402), 
      HS78(0.035417). KKT measure is listed in the parenthesis.
Error status: BT4, HS56.
Opt status: rest.

--------Small proximal parameter--------
BT7, BT8.

--------Timing-------
Our method takes far less time than the competing method. Test problem "LCH" is an exception. I have a
rough guess on why LCH takes so much time. It has something to do with subproblem reformulation and 
I am still testing to verify my guess.

### EXTROSNBNE test problem is still running. The above discussion excludes this test problem.
